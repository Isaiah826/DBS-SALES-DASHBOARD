# DBS-SALES-DASHBOARD
The dataset was provided by DBS Motors with the aim of cleaning the data, building a data model, and creating an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel.

To achieve this, the dataset was cleaned using various formulas and functions in Excel. Additionally, a few unnecessary columns were removed to prepare the data for modeling.

The dataset was then structured into fact and dimension tables:

Dimension Tables: Product table and Customer table
Fact Table: Sales table
This structured approach was essential for building a robust data model and ensuring meaningful insights could be derived from the dashboard.
